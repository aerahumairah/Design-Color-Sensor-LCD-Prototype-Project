# Design-Color-Sensor-LCD-Prototype-Project
A project that requires students to produce their own prototype using sensors of their choice, and produce a product that targets the child development process. 

This project uses an **Arduino Uno**, **TCS3200 color sensor**, and **16x2 LCD** to detect colors and display results on the LCD screen.  
The circuit was designed in **Multisim** and later fabricated into a **PCB board**, which was soldered and assembled into a working prototype.  

---

## Features
- Detects object color using the TCS3200 sensor.
- Displays color name/value on LCD.
- Designed with Multisim and fabricated into a PCB.
- Final prototype tested successfully.

## Project Structure
src/ → Arduino C++ code (.ino)
schematics/ → Circuit & PCB screenshots (from Multisim)
prototype/ → Photos of soldered PCB, prototype & flashcards

---

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno  
- TCS3200 Color Sensor  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Resistors
- Custom PCB  

---

## How to Run
1. Open `src/Color_sensor_and_lcd_project.ino` in Arduino IDE.  
2. Wire Arduino Uno, color sensor, and LCD following the schematic images in `schematics/`.  
3. Upload code to Arduino.  
4. Detected color will display on the LCD.  

---

## Results
- Fully working prototype tested with colored objects.  
- Final prototype photos available in `prototype/`.
